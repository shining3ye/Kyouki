Like for no reason she was diffrent.For the firt time.
FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE HELD MY HAND AND PULLED ME OUT OF THE DARKNESS...
she made my fall for her....i fell deep inside her.She locked my eyes on her....
And here all Started """The End Of Beginning"""From the day You confessed to me.
Until now i'm falling. Deeper and deeper, every day, she was the first one i loved Truly,
You made me learn what is love, i never knew that, you are that girl Tanjina,
and ik she did the same, we're two lover who was tring to create a bond and connection.
And we made it. I love You and she does the same a lottt moreee than i do...
